const genesis2 = `2  Thus the heavens and the earth and everything in them* were completed.a 2  And by the seventh day, God had completed the work that he had been doing,* and he began to rest on the seventh day from all his work that he had been doing.*b 3  And God went on to bless the seventh day and to declare it sacred, for on it God has been resting from all the work that he has created, all that he purposed to make.
4  This is a history of the heavens and the earth in the time they were created, in the day that Jehovah* God made earth and heaven.c
5  No bush of the field was yet on the earth and no vegetation of the field had begun sprouting, because Jehovah God had not made it rain on the earth and there was no man to cultivate the ground. 6  But a mist would go up from the earth, and it watered the entire surface of the ground.
7  And Jehovah God went on to form the man out of dustd from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life,e and the man became a living person.*f 8  Further, Jehovah God planted a garden in Eʹden,g toward the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed.h 9  Thus Jehovah God made to grow out of the ground every tree that was pleasing to look at and good for food and also the tree of lifei in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and bad.j
10  Now there was a river flowing out of Eʹden to water the garden, and from there it divided into four rivers.* 11  The name of the first is Piʹshon; it is the one encircling the entire land of Havʹi·lah, where there is gold. 12  The gold of that land is good. Bdellium gum and onyx stone are also there. 13  The name of the second river is Giʹhon; it is the one encircling the entire land of Cush. 14  The name of the third river is Hidʹde·kel;*k it is the one going to the east of As·syrʹi·a.l And the fourth river is the Eu·phraʹtes.m
15  Jehovah God took the man and settled him in the garden of Eʹden to cultivate it and to take care of it.n 16  Jehovah God also gave this command to the man: “From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction.o 17  But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die.”p
18  Then Jehovah God said: “It is not good for the man to continue to be alone. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him.”q 19  Now Jehovah God had been forming from the ground every wild animal of the field and every flying creature of the heavens, and he began bringing them to the man to see what he would call each one; and whatever the man would call each living creature,* that became its name.r 20  So the man named all the domestic animals and the flying creatures of the heavens and every wild animal of the field, but for man there was no helper as a complement of him. 21  So Jehovah God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he was sleeping, he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place. 22  And Jehovah God built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman, and he brought her to the man.s
23  Then the man said:
“This is at last bone of my bones
And flesh of my flesh.
This one will be called Woman,
Because from man she was taken.”t
24  That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to* his wife, and they will become one flesh.u 25  And both of them continued to be naked,v the man and his wife; yet they were not ashamed.`;

var genesis1 = `1  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.a
2  Now the earth was formless and desolate,* and there was darkness upon the surface of the watery deep,*b and God’s active force*c was moving about over the surface of the waters.d
3  And God said: “Let there be light.” Then there was light.e 4  After that God saw that the light was good, and God began to divide the light from the darkness. 5  God called the light Day, but the darkness he called Night.f And there was evening and there was morning, a first day.
6  Then God said: “Let there be an expanseg between the waters, and let there be a division between the waters and the waters.”h 7  Then God went on to make the expanse and divided the waters beneath the expanse from the waters above the expanse.i And it was so. 8  God called the expanse Heaven.* And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.
9  Then God said: “Let the waters under the heavens be collected together into one place, and let the dry land appear.”j And it was so. 10  God called the dry land Earth,k but the collecting of the waters, he called Seas.l And God saw that it was good.m 11  Then God said: “Let the earth cause grass to sprout, seed-bearing plants and fruit trees according to their kinds, yielding fruit along with seed on the earth.” And it was so. 12  And the earth began to produce grass, seed-bearing plantsn and trees yielding fruit along with seed, according to their kinds. Then God saw that it was good. 13  And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.
14  Then God said: “Let there be luminaries*o in the expanse of the heavens to make a division between the day and the night,p and they will serve as signs for seasons and for days and years.q 15  They will serve as luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth.” And it was so. 16  And God went on to make the two great luminaries, the greater luminary for dominating the dayr and the lesser luminary for dominating the night, and also the stars.s 17  Thus God put them in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth 18  and to dominate by day and by night and to make a division between the light and the darkness.t Then God saw that it was good. 19  And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
20  Then God said: “Let the waters swarm with living creatures,* and let flying creatures fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.”*u 21  And God created the great sea creatures* and all living creatures* that move and swarm in the waters according to their kinds and every winged flying creature according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22  With that God blessed them, saying: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the waters of the sea,v and let the flying creatures become many in the earth.” 23  And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
24  Then God said: “Let the earth bring forth living creatures* according to their kinds, domestic animals and creeping animals* and wild animals of the earth according to their kinds.”w And it was so. 25  And God went on to make the wild animals of the earth according to their kinds and the domestic animals according to their kinds and all the creeping animals of the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
26  Then God said: “Let usx make man in our image,y according to our likeness,z and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals and all the earth and every creeping animal that is moving on the earth.”a 27  And God went on to create the man in his image, in God’s image he created him; male and female he created them.b 28  Further, God blessed them, and God said to them: “Be fruitful and become many, fill the earthc and subdue it,d and have in subjectione the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving on the earth.”
29  Then God said: “Here I have given to you every seed-bearing plant that is on the entire earth and every tree with seed-bearing fruit. Let them serve as food for you.f 30  And to every wild animal of the earth and to every flying creature of the heavens and to everything moving on the earth in which there is life,* I have given all green vegetation for food.”g And it was so.
31  After that God saw everything he had made, and look! it was very good.h And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.`;

var psalms78 = `78  Listen, my people, to my law;*
Incline your ear to the words of my mouth.
 2  I will open my mouth in a proverb.
I will propound riddles of long ago.b
 3  The things we have heard and know,
Which our fathers have related to us,c
 4  We will not hide from their sons;
We will relate to the generation to comed
The praiseworthy deeds of Jehovah and his strength,e
The wonderful things he has done.f
 5  He established a reminder in Jacob
And set a law in Israel;
He commanded our forefathers
To make these things known to their children,g
 6  So that the next generation,
The children yet to be born, might know them.h
They in turn would relate them to their children.i
 7  Then these would put their confidence in God.
They would not forget God’s worksj
But would observe his commandments.k
 8  Then they would not be like their forefathers,
A stubborn and rebellious generation,l
A generation whose heart was unsteady*m
And whose spirit was not faithful to God.
 9  The Eʹphra·im·ites were armed with the bow,
But they retreated in the day of battle.
10  They did not keep the covenant of Godn
And refused to walk in his law.o
11  They also forgot what he had done,p
His wonderful works that he showed them.q
12  He did marvelous things in the sight of their forefathers,r
In the land of Egypt, the region of Zoʹan.s
13  He split the sea to let them pass through,
And he made the waters stand up like a dam.*t
14  He led them with a cloud by day
And the whole night with the light of a fire.u
15  He split rocks in the wilderness,
He let them drink their fill as if from deep waters.v
16  He brought streams out of a crag
And caused waters to flow down like rivers.w
17  But they continued to sin against him
By rebelling against the Most High in the desert;x
18  They challenged* God in their hearty
By demanding food that they craved.*
19  So they spoke against God,
Saying: “Can God spread a table in the wilderness?”z
20  Look! He struck a rock
So that waters flowed and streams flooded out.a
“Can he also give us bread,
Or can he provide meat for his people?”b
21  When Jehovah heard them, he became furious;c
A fired blazed against Jacob,
And his anger flared up against Israele
22  Because they did not put faith in God;f
They did not trust in his ability to save them.
23  So he commanded the cloudy skies above,
And he opened the doors of heaven.
24  He kept raining down manna for them to eat;
He gave them the grain of heaven.g
25  Men ate the bread of mighty ones;*h
He provided enough to satisfy them.i
26  He stirred up the east wind in the heavens
And made a south wind blow by his power.j
27  And he rained down meat on them like dust,
Birds like the sand of the seashore.
28  He made them fall in the midst of his camp,
All around his tents.
29  And they ate and gorged themselves;
He gave them what they desired.k
30  But before they fully satisfied their craving,
While their food was yet in their mouth,
31  God’s wrath flared up against them.l
He put to death their strongest men;m
He brought down the young men of Israel.
32  Despite this they sinned even moren
And did not put faith in his wonderful works.o
33  So he brought their days to an end as if a mere breath,p
And their years by sudden terrors.
34  But as often as he killed them, they would search for him;q
They would return and look for God,
35  Remembering that God was their Rockr
And that the Most High God was their Redeemer.*s
36  But they tried to deceive him with their mouth
And lied to him with their tongue.
37  Their heart was not steadfast toward him;t
And they were not faithful to his covenant.u
38  But he was merciful;v
He would forgive* their error and not bring them to ruin.w
He often held back his angerx
Instead of stirring up all his wrath.
39  For he remembered that they were flesh,y
A wind that blows past and does not return.*
40  How often they rebelled against him in the wildernessz
And made him feel hurt in the desert!a
41  Again and again they put God to the test,b
And they grieved* the Holy One of Israel.
42  They did not remember his power,*
The day that he rescued* them from the adversary,c
43  How he displayed his signs in Egyptd
And his miracles in the region of Zoʹan,
44  And how he turned the Nile canals into bloode
So that they could not drink from their streams.
45  He sent swarms of gadflies to devour themf
And frogs to bring them to ruin.g
46  He gave their crops to the voracious locusts,
The fruit of their labor to the swarming locusts.h
47  He destroyed their vines with haili
And their sycamore trees with hailstones.
48  He gave their beasts of burden over to the hailj
And their livestock to the lightning bolts.*
49  He inflicted his burning anger on them,
Fury and indignation and distress,
Companies of angels bringing calamity.
50  He cleared a pathway for his anger.
He did not spare them* from death;
And he gave them* over to pestilence.
51  Finally he struck down all the firstborn of Egypt,k
The beginning of their procreative power in the tents of Ham.
52  Then he brought his people out like a flockl
And guided them like a drove in the wilderness.
53  He led them in security,
And they felt no fear;m
The sea covered their enemies.n
54  And he brought them to his holy territory,o
This mountainous region that his right hand acquired.p
55  He drove out the nations from before them;q
He allotted to them an inheritance by the measuring line;r
He settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.s
56  But they kept challenging* God the Most High, and rebelling against him;t
They did not pay attention to his reminders.u
57  They also turned away and were as treacherous as their forefathers.v
They were as unreliable as a loose bow.w
58  They kept offending him with their high places,x
And they incited him to fury* with their carved images.y
59  God heard and became furious,z
So he utterly rejected Israel.
60  He finally forsook the tabernacle of Shiʹloh,a
The tent where he had resided among men.b
61  He let the symbol of his strength go into captivity;
His splendor into the hand of the adversary.c
62  He handed his people over to the swordd
And became furious with his inheritance.
63  Fire consumed his young men,
And to his virgins no wedding songs were sung.*
64  His priests fell by the sword,e
And their own widows did not weep.f
65  Then Jehovah woke up as from sleep,g
Like a mighty manh waking up from wine.
66  And he drove his adversaries back;i
He put them to lasting disgrace.
67  He rejected the tent of Joseph;
He did not choose the tribe of Eʹphra·im.
68  But he chose the tribe of Judah,j
Mount Zion, which he loves.k
69  He made his sanctuary as enduring as the heavens,*l
Like the earth that he has established forever.m
70  He chose Davidn his servant
And took him from the sheep pens,o
71  From tending the nursing ewes;
He made him the shepherd over Jacob, his people,p
And over Israel, his inheritance.q
72  He shepherded them with integrity of heart,r
And with skillful hands he led them.s`;
